A dolphin saw the monkey fighting with the waves. Suddenly, a dolphin appeared and picked him up. They soon reached the Island. And the monkey came down from the dolphin&rsquo;s back. The dolphin asked the monkey, &ldquo;Do you know this place&rdquo; The monkey replied, &ldquo;Yes, I do! In fact, the king of the Island is my best friend. Do you know that I am actually a prince?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Knowing that no one lived on the Island, the dolphin said, &ldquo;Well! Well! So you are a Prince! Now you can be the King!&rdquo; The monkey asked, &ldquo;How can I be the King?&rdquo; As the dolphin started swimming away, she answered, &ldquo;That is easy as you are the only creature on this Island, you will naturally be the King.&rdquo; The dolphin, indignant at these falsehoods went away leaving the monkey on the Island.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eee;border:1px solid #ccc;padding:5px 10px;\"><strong><em>MORAL: </em></strong></div>\n\n<p><strong><em>THOSE WHO LIKE AND BOAST MAY END UP IN TROUBLE.</em></strong></p>\n"

From the golden-brown coat that was speckled with grey-white spots to the tip of his short black tail, every inch of him was a delight to look at. Even among the hundred deer that lived in the forest, there were none that looked as beautiful as him.

After he finished, he stood there listening to the sounds around him. Suddenly his eye fell on the water. Before he stood a magnificent stag and he had the most stunning pair of antlers. The stag lowered his head to get a quick look and to his amazement, the stag in the water too did the same. Almost two feet high, with a strong beam, the antlers curved inwards, almost like carved tree branches.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The Stag and his Reflection image-3.

Then his eyes fell on his legs.</p>\n\n<p>They looked thin and ugly to him. &ldquo;Oh god! These are like twigs,&rdquo; he thought in dismay. &ldquo;Every single part of me looks good, except for these ugly stumps.&rdquo; He looked at himself, again and again, each time the conclusion was the same: but for his stick-like legs, he was beautiful. Yes, his antlers were really praise-worthy.</p>\n\n<p>The thought about his ugly legs kept haunting him so much that he did not eat or sleep well for the next few days.</p>\n\n<p>His thoughts pulled him both ways. &ldquo;Why was I made perfect, except for these four sticks?&rdquo; he thought and then he also thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure there must be a reason my legs were made without much care.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"he Stag and his Reflection image-5.

The stag leaped and ran for his life.</p>\n\n<p>He dashed through the dry grass, sped over the thicket, leaped over boulders, and raced. All the time the tiger was chasing him hard. He also knew that if he kept the speed, the tiger would not be able to catch him. And the stag would have escaped. His powerful legs made him as fast as the wind.</p>\n\n<p>But in a little while, he came across a wooded area, full of trees and twisted branches, and while his legs kept the speed, his massive, beautiful antlers got entangled in the branches of a tree.

In tears, he looked at his legs.

Then after sundown, when the rosy light fades from the sky and the shadows rise slowly through the wood, out she comes ruffling and blinking from the old hollow tree. Now her weird &ldquo;hoo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo&rdquo; echoes through the quiet wood, and she begins her hunt for the bugs and beetles, frogs and mice she likes so well to eat.</p>\n\n<p>Now there was a certain old Owl who had become very cross and hard to please as she grew older, especially if anything disturbed her daily slumbers. One warm summer afternoon as she dozed away in her den in the old oak tree, a Grasshopper nearby began a joyous but very raspy song. Out popped the old Owl&rsquo;s head from the opening in the tree that served her both for the door and for the window.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The Owl and the Grasshopper image-2.

Then he struck up a louder and still more rasping tune.</p>\n\n<p>The wise old Owl knew quite well that it would do no good to argue with the Grasshopper, nor with anybody else for that matter. Besides, her eyes were not sharp enough by day to permit her to punish the Grasshopper as he deserved.

A herd of sheep lazily grazing at the grass. Mr. Wolf&rsquo;s eyes were glazed with tears of joy.</p>\n\n<p>It was not very long before he was tucking into a warm juicy meal. Yummy!

There&nbsp;was a crafty wild animal out there eating his sheep!</p>\n\n<p>The friend arrived and the farmer decided, it was time for a small feast. &ldquo;I will get my biggest sheep and you cook up something wonderful,&rdquo; he told his wife.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The Wolf in a Sheep’s Skin image-7.

Further, he also mentioned that soon after he wins the race, the tortoise would be ridiculed by other animals for accepting the dare. The tortoise kept silent and didn&rsquo;t pay heed to the hare&rsquo;s words.</p>\n\n<p>The race began at the count of one, two, and three! The hare immediately started running and the tortoise started at its usual slow pace. Soon the hare reached a long way ahead almost a few yards from the finish line. He looked back to check if the tortoise was anywhere nearby. However, the tortoise was left far behind and almost could not be seen.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The Tortoise and The Hare image-3.

He looked around and to his left, he noticed a field of cabbages and carrots. He decided to snack on cabbage and take a short nap so that he can quickly run past the finish line in a fresh mood.</p>\n\n<p>Soon the hare fell into a deep sleep and dreamt of winning the competition. Time passed and the sun was already setting when he suddenly woke up. He quickly jumped to check if the tortoise was around. To his dismay, the tortoise was just a few steps away from the finish line.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing the tortoise close to the finish line, the hare rushed towards it as fast as he could.

A herd of sheep lazily grazing at the grass. Mr. Wolf&rsquo;s eyes were glazed with tears of joy.</p>\n\n<p>It was not very long before he was tucking into a warm juicy meal. Yummy! Just as he was finishing, he thought wistfully, &ldquo;When I will get something like this to eat again, this easily?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He knew from the past few months how hard hunting had been. Mr. Wolf sighed.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly, he saw the skin of the sheep he had peeled off and eaten. He had an idea.

They all looked calm and healthy. In fact, there was one sheep looking really very healthy.

Tall, with bright brown eyes and a gentle nose, he always held his neck at an angle that was graceful and majestic. From the golden-brown coat that was speckled with grey-white spots to the tip of his short black tail, every inch of him was a delight to look at.

After he finished, he stood there listening to the sounds around him. Suddenly his eye fell on the water. Before he stood a magnificent stag and he had the most stunning pair of antlers. The stag lowered his head to get a quick look and to his amazement, the stag in the water too did the same. Almost two feet high, with a strong beam, the antlers curved inwards, almost like carved tree branches.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The Stag and his Reflection image-3.

His powerful legs made him as fast as the wind.</p>\n\n<p>But in a little while, he came across a wooded area, full of trees and twisted branches, and while his legs kept the speed, his massive, beautiful antlers got entangled in the branches of a tree.

I&rsquo;m innocent. &rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Another said, &ldquo;I have been framed. I am innocent too.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, King saw that all prisoners there were trying to prove their innocence to King.</p>\n\n<p>Just then King saw a prisoner sitting in a corner with his head down crying. King went to him and asked, &ldquo;Why are you crying?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>Prisoner replied with humility, &ldquo;I was troubled by my poverty and stole. I have no doubt about justice. I did an offense and I got punished for it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>The king thought that the law of punishment does not create a sense of atonement inside all but this is one of those prisoners who is atoning for his mistake. If this person is freed from penalties then he can improve himself.</p>\n\n<p>So, the king freed him.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eee;border:1px solid #ccc;padding:5px 10px;\"><strong>Moral of the Story: </strong></div>\n\n<p><strong>It is Always Better, to Tell the Truth.</strong></p>\n"

The tortoise kept silent and didn&rsquo;t pay heed to the hare&rsquo;s words.</p>\n\n<p>The race began at the count of one, two, and three!

Time passed and the sun was already setting when he suddenly woke up. He quickly jumped to check if the tortoise was around.

Now her weird &ldquo;hoo-hoo-hoo-oo-oo&rdquo; echoes through the quiet wood, and she begins her hunt for the bugs and beetles, frogs and mice she likes so well to eat.</p>\n\n<p>Now there was a certain old Owl who had become very cross and hard to please as she grew older, especially if anything disturbed her daily slumbers. One warm summer afternoon as she dozed away in her den in the old oak tree, a Grasshopper nearby began a joyous but very raspy song. Out popped the old Owl&rsquo;s head from the opening in the tree that served her both for the door and for the window.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The Owl and the Grasshopper image-2.

Besides, her eyes were not sharp enough by day to permit her to punish the Grasshopper as he deserved.

A herd of sheep lazily grazing at the grass. Mr. Wolf&rsquo;s eyes were glazed with tears of joy.</p>\n\n<p>It was not very long before he was tucking into a warm juicy meal. Yummy! Just as he was finishing, he thought wistfully, &ldquo;When I will get something like this to eat again, this easily?&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>He knew from the past few months how hard hunting had been. Mr. Wolf sighed.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly, he saw the skin of the sheep he had peeled off and eaten. He had an idea.

      "details": "<p>A long, long time ago, there lived a hare in the forest who always boasted of his running speed. Often, he would tease the tortoise for being the slowest animal around. One fine day, he dared the tortoise to a race in order to exhibit his skills in front of other animals in the forest. Fed up with the hare&rsquo;s bragging, the tortoise finally accepted the challenge and decided to compete with him in a race.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The Tortoise and The Hare image-2.

Just as they were about to begin the race, the hare mocked the tortoise for accepting the challenge. Further, he also mentioned that soon after he wins the race, the tortoise would be ridiculed by other animals for accepting the dare. The tortoise kept silent and didn&rsquo;t pay heed to the hare&rsquo;s words.</p>\n\n<p>The race began at the count of one, two, and three! The hare immediately started running and the tortoise started at its usual slow pace. Soon the hare reached a long way ahead almost a few yards from the finish line. He looked back to check if the tortoise was anywhere nearby. However, the tortoise was left far behind and almost could not be seen.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The Tortoise and The Hare image-3.

He looked around and to his left, he noticed a field of cabbages and carrots. He decided to snack on cabbage and take a short nap so that he can quickly run past the finish line in a fresh mood.</p>\n\n<p>Soon the hare fell into a deep sleep and dreamt of winning the competition. Time passed and the sun was already setting when he suddenly woke up. He quickly jumped to check if the tortoise was around. To his dismay, the tortoise was just a few steps away from the finish line.</p>\n\n<p>Seeing the tortoise close to the finish line, the hare rushed towards it as fast as he could. However, it was already too late and the tortoise finally crossed the finish line, thereby winning the competition.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"The Tortoise and The Hare image-4.

That very day, he learned a lesson that bragging about something doesn&rsquo;t win you accolades, hence you should never mock others for their own pace.</p>\n\n<div style=\"background:#eee;border:1px solid #ccc;padding:5px 10px;\"><em><strong>Moral of the Story</strong></em><strong>:</strong></div>\n\n<p><strong>Slow and steady wins the race!</strong></p>\n"
